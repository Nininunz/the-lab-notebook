# Mirror Removal and Installation

This process involves carefully removing the existing mirror and installing the new one. The procedure is the same whether you're replacing a basic mirror or upgrading from a factory electrochromic unit.

**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes<br />
**Tools Required:** Nothing special, just your hands

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Mirror Trim

This step is straightforward. The trim cover design may vary slightly between models, but the removal method is the same. Unclip the cover carefully, then swivel the mirror as needed to fully detach the trim once it's loose.

### Step 2: Unplug Mirror Connector

Locate the main connector block at the top of the mirror. Some vehicles may have additional smaller plugs, but the large multi-pin connector is the one you need. Gently move any surrounding wires aside for easier access, then unplug the connector.

### Step 3: Detach Mirror from Windshield

Use caution during this step — the mirror mount is bonded to the glass, and forcing it incorrectly can crack or shatter the windshield. Support the mirror with both hands and rotate it **to the right** to release it from the mount. Do not apply pressure in any other direction.

  **Pro Tip:** For safe removal, ensure moderate temperatures (18-28 °C / 64-82
  °F). If the car has been in extreme heat or cold, let it sit indoors or under
  shade for 30 minutes to reduce stress on the glass.

### Step 3.5: No Pre-Existing Connector

If your vehicle was not equipped with an electrochromic mirror from the factory and you do not find a connector behind the mount, skip ahead to [Adding a Harness](/projects/homelink-retrofit/wiring-the-new-harness).
Otherwise, proceed directly to Step 4.

### Step 4: Install the New Mirror

Position the replacement mirror on the windshield mount and rotate it **to the left** until it locks in place. Reconnect the main harness plug, then reinstall the trim cover. When refitting the trim, pay close attention to any additional wiring for options such as the rain sensor, auto-beam assist, or other mirror-mounted features to avoid pinching or misrouting wires.

In short — complete Steps 1-3 in reverse order.

### Step 5 (Optional): Compass Calibration

If the new mirror's compass is inaccurate or displays a **"C"**, calibration may be required.

- **Magnetic Zone Setting:** Press the hidden button until a number shows, then cycle to the correct zone for your region.
- **Calibration:** Press until **"C"** appears, then drive 2-3 slow circles (~10 mph) until the direction display returns.

  Calibration is only necessary if the compass does not function correctly after
  installation.
