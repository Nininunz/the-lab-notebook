# Introduction

This write-up documents my retrofit of a BMW HomeLink-equipped rearview mirror in my **2005 E83 X3**, which originally came with only a standard electrochromic (auto-dimming) mirror.
Most of the information in this guide is actually irrelevant for my specific E83, since I had pre-existing wiring.
This retrofit ended up being only a **10-minute endeavor**.

## Scope

While this guide primarily focuses on **HomeLink integration**, it applies to retrofitting:

- Electrochromic mirrors (auto-dimming)
- HomeLink (garage door opener)
- Digital compass mirrors

The information here should cover essentially all late-90s onward **E-chassis BMWs**.

For vehicles without pre-existing wiring, instructions are included for creating harnesses on the following platforms:
**E38, E39, E46, E53, E60, E61, E63, E83**

<Callout type='info'>
  Always confirm wiring and connector presence before starting, especially on
  European-spec base models

<Callout type='important'>
  **WIP:** The project is complete, but the detailed documentation is still to
  come.
