# Choosing the Right Mirror

BMW offered a wide range of rearview mirror configurations during the E83 era
(and across many other E-chassis vehicles). These spanned from basic,
non-wired mirrors to advanced versions with features like auto-dimming,
HomeLink garage integration, digital compass, and even rarer options such as
high-beam assist or lane-departure warning.

## Functional Variations

Part numbers vary widely — there are dozens of mirror variants across model
years and trims. For more information on what exists, consult
[RealOEM](https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/select) or a similar dealer parts
catalog.

**The terms you will see in the parts catalog are as follows:**

- **EC** = Electrochromic (auto-dimming)
- **GTO** = HomeLink (garage door opener)
- **TLC** = Lane departure warning
- **FLA** = High-beam assistant
- **ETC** = Electronic Toll Collection
- **Radio** = Radio-wave remote control (believed to be convertible-exclusive)
- **Remote** = (same as radio)
- **LED** = Alarm system LED
- **Compass** = Digital compass

<Callout>
  All electrochromic mirrors include the LED for the alarm system.

  There are probably other variations I haven't encountered, but these are the
  main ones.

### Common Configurations

**These are typical configurations you will encounter:**

- **EC** — auto-dimming only
- **EC/GTO** — auto-dimming with integrated garage door opener
- **EC/Compass** — auto-dimming with digital compass
- **EC/GTO/Compass** — auto-dimming with opener and compass
- **Manual** — standard mirror - no wires, no auto-dimming

### Compass Styles

Compass mirrors came in two versions: early models with a visible cutout, and post-2006 versions with a hidden display.

## Some Important Things to Note

If your car came with a **basic electrochromic mirror** (auto-dimming only),
you can swap in essentially any upgraded mirror — even ones with additional
features you don't plan to use. Extra functions that aren't supported by your
car's wiring will simply remain inactive, and they won't cause problems.

That said, installing a mirror pulled from a car with **driver-assistance
features like Lane Departure Warning or High Beam Assistant** won't magically
add those functions to your vehicle. Those systems require dedicated sensors,
wiring, and module integration beyond the mirror itself. The only exceptions
are **HomeLink** and the **digital compass** — and likely **Electronic Toll
Collection**, though unverified — since these operate independently of the
car's electronics and will work as standalone features once powered.

Some mirrors also came with an **SOS / BMW Assist button** integrated into the
housing. Swapping one of these into your car won't magically provide SOS
functionality — the system relied on separate telematics hardware, an active
subscription, and a backend service that has **long since been discontinued**.
Today, those buttons are purely cosmetic — **and an eyesore at that**.

---

### General Notes

- **All electrochromic mirrors** include the **LED for the alarm system**, even if the vehicle is not equipped with an alarm.
- **Mirror housings differ** — a standard mirror housing will not always fit an electrochromic mirror and vice versa.
- **HomeLink and compass functions are independent** of the vehicle's CAN/K-Bus systems; they only require power and ground. This means if you already have an electrochromic mirror, you can often add HomeLink or compass simply by swapping in the upgraded mirror.
- **If your car is not pre-wired** for an electrochromic mirror, any EC mirror can be used to add the function — wiring just needs to be supplied.

---

### Market-Specific Features

- **ETC** is possibly exclusive to the Japanese market.
- **Radio-wave remote control** appears to have been limited to convertibles (though this may not be true).
- **Lane assist (TLC)** has not been observed on North American E-chassis models, though it likely existed elsewhere.

---

### Part Numbers

These are factory mirror options for a **pre-LCI E83**:

- `51169218046` — Basic mirror (non-EC)
- `51169134459` — Electrochromic mirror (EC) only
- `51169134458` — Electrochromic mirror with HomeLink (GTO) - no compass

Keep in mind these are only a few examples. BMW offered many variations across different models and markets.

<Callout type='info'>
  The mirror I used was pulled out of my blown up donor LCI E90.
</Callout>
<Callout>
  You don't need to source a mirror from the same chassis. Mirrors from other
  E-chassis vehicles of this era are interchangeable as long as the connector
  matches.
