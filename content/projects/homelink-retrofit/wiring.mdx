## Wiring Overview (No Pre-Existing Harness)

This section applies to **E38, E39, E46, E53, E60, E61, E63, and E83** retrofits where the vehicle did not come pre-wired for an electrochromic mirror.

Your connector layout may look different depending on chassis, but the wiring functions are consistent: **signal, ground, and power.**

#### OEM Approach

BMW offers a complete wiring harness kit for this retrofit:

**Part Number:** `61120140175` <br/>
**Compatible with:** E38 / E39 / E46 / E53 / E60 / E61 / E63 / E83

**Available from:** [FCP](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw-set-of-retrofit-cablesremote-rv-mirror-61120140175), [Turner](https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-137565-61120140175-genuine-bmw-part/), [ECS](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-genuine-bmw-parts/rear-view-mirror-retrofit-cable-set/61120140175/)

This kit includes all necessary wiring, connectors, and installation hardware. However, it's quite costly for what is essentially some wire and a connector.

#### Budget-Friendly Alternative

<Callout type='info'>
  **DIY Solution:** If you don't mind sourcing parts and wrapping harnesses.
</Callout>

**Required Components:**

- **Connector:**
  - Available from [Tulay's Wire Werks](https://tulayswirewerks.com/product/bmw-10-pin-teal-unsealed-plug-connector-kit/) (connector + pins kit)
  - Can be sourced from junkyard components: clockspring, mirror, driver window switch, turn signal stalk, wiper stalk, etc.

    _Note: This connector uses various BMW part numbers depending on color and can't really be found by it._

- **Pins:**
  - **Female:** `61138722287` (for 0.35mm wire)
  - **Male:** `61138722314` (for 0.35mm wire) - _Don't actually need, just providing for reference._

- **Wire:** 22 AWG / 0.35mm² wire (various colors)
- **Tape:** `Tesa 51608` harness tape - _Any harness tape will do but this is what BMW uses._

**Required Tools:**

- **Crimpers:** I have [these IWISS crimpers](https://www.amazon.com/IWISS-Crimping-AWG28-20-Terminals-Connectors/dp/B078WNZ9FW/), but any that handle 0.35 mm² (22 AWG) terminals should work fine.
- **Scissors:** For cutting wire and tape.
- **Wire Strippers:** Anything that can strip 0.35 mm² (22 AWG) wire works.

### Wiring Diagram

In this diagram, **A22 (mirror)** connects with **X18246 (10-pin connector).**

The relevant wires are:

- **Pin 1 — S_RS+**: signal wire for the mirror’s auto-dimming function
- **Pin 3 — 15&lt;24**: switched power (Terminal 15, Fuse 24)
- **Pin 10 — 31E**: ground

<Callout type='info'>
  If you sourced your connector from a mirror at the junkyard you may notice
  extra wires on pins **4, 5, 6, 7**. These are for outside mirror dimming and
  can be disregarded or this retrofit.
</Callout>
<Callout type='warning'>
  **Important:** This wiring diagram is specific to my E83. Pin destinations may
  differ between models, but the wires coming **out of the mirror itself** are
  consistent. Your fuse will **not** be the same.

### Wiring to Chassis

Now this is the part where you'll have to consult your specific vehicle's wiring diagram, as it will be different for every model.

#### Shortcut Wiring Method

If you want a simpler approach, you can tap into nearby switched power and ground instead of running wires all the way to the fuse panel.

For example:

- **Power (Terminal 15)** → use the sunroof harness
- **Ground** → nearby ground point

Because the mirror's current draw is very low, this is generally safe.

You will still need to run the **S_RS+ signal wire** to a valid connection point. In many cases, tapping into the existing run is sufficient if the signal is already shared with other systems. If not, route the wire directly to the originating module.

<Callout type='warning'>
  Always double-check what you tap into. Never splice into safety-critical
  systems such as airbags.
</Callout>

im unable to confirm at this time but it looks like bmw used the same windshield mount for the mirror going back to at least the e36. that would make this mirror almost plug and play if you wanted homelink and compass and didnt care about auto dimming. as ive mentioned, those work independently of the car so you could just run power and ground to the mirror and it would work. you could use 12v from the dome lights.
