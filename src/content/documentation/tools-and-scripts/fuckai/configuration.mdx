# Configuration File (`.fuckai`)

You can create a `.fuckai` file in your project root to configure emoji scanning behavior. The file supports:

## File Type Configuration

Control which file types to search:

**Include Mode** — Search only specific file types:
```bash
# Only search TypeScript and JavaScript files
type: *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx
```

**Exclude Mode** — Search all files except specific types:
```bash
# Search everything except JSON and YAML files
exclude: *.json, *.yml, *.yaml
```

**Default file types** (when no `type:` or `exclude:` is specified):
- `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`
- `*.json`, `*.md`, `*.yml`, `*.yaml`
- `*.sh`, `*.mjs`

## File/Pattern Ignoring

Ignore specific files or patterns (one per line):

```bash
# Ignore all test files
**/*.test.*

# Ignore a specific file
src/content/notes/emoji-allowed.mdx

# Ignore everything in a folder
src/legacy/**

# Ignore the script itself
scripts/fuckai.sh
```

## Complete Example

```bash
# Files and patterns to ignore when searching for emojis
# One pattern per line, supports basic wildcards

# File type configuration (optional):
# Use "type:" to include only specific file types (overrides defaults)
# Use "exclude:" to search all files EXCEPT the specified types
# Default: *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx, *.json, *.md, *.yml, *.yaml, *.sh, *.mjs

# Only search TypeScript files
type: *.ts, *.tsx

# Ignore specific files
scripts/fuckai.sh
**/*.test.*
```

**Note:** Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.
