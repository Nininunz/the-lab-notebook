## Utility Guidelines

Utilities in this project:

- **Single purpose** - Each utility has a clear, focused responsibility
- **Well-tested** - Include comprehensive test coverage where applicable
- **Type-safe** - Use TypeScript or JSDoc for type annotations
- **Documented** - Clear parameter descriptions and usage examples

All utilities are located in the `lib/` directory and can be imported using the `@/lib/` alias.
