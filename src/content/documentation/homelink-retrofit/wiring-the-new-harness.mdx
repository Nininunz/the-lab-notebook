# Wiring The New Harness

<div className='mt-5'>
  This section applies to **E38, E39, E46, E53, E60, E61, E63, and E83**
  retrofits where the vehicle did not come pre-wired for an electrochromic
  mirror. If your vehicle **already has a connector** behind the windshield
  mount, you can **skip this section.**
</div>

## Overview

#### OEM Approach

<div className='mt-5'>
  BMW offers a complete wiring harness kit for this retrofit:
</div>

**Part Number:** `61120140175` <br/>
**Compatible with:** E38 / E39 / E46 / E53 / E60 / E61 / E63 / E83

<div className='mt-5'>
  **Available from:**
  [FCP](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw-set-of-retrofit-cablesremote-rv-mirror-61120140175),
  [Turner](https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-137565-61120140175-genuine-bmw-part/),
  [ECS](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-genuine-bmw-parts/rear-view-mirror-retrofit-cable-set/61120140175/)
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  This kit includes all necessary wiring, connectors, and installation hardware.
  However, it's quite costly for what is essentially some wire and a connector.
</div>

#### Budget-Friendly Alternative

<div className='mt-5'>
  **DIY Solution:** If you don't mind sourcing parts and wrapping harnesses.
</div>

**Required Components:**

- **Connector:**
  - Available from
    [Tulay's Wire Werks](https://tulayswirewerks.com/product/bmw-10-pin-teal-unsealed-plug-connector-kit/)
    (connector + pins kit)
  - Can be sourced from junkyard components: clockspring, mirror, driver window
    switch, turn signal stalk, wiper stalk, etc.

    _Note: This connector uses various BMW part numbers depending on color and
    can't really be found by it._

- **Pins:**
  - **Female:** `61138722287` (for 0.35mm wire)
  - **Male:** `61138722314` (for 0.35mm wire) - _Don't actually need, just
    providing for reference._

- **Wire:** 22 AWG / 0.35mm² wire (various colors)
- **Tape:** `Tesa 51608` harness tape - _Any harness tape will do but this is
  what BMW uses._

**Required Tools:**

- **Crimpers:** I have
  [these IWISS crimpers](https://www.amazon.com/IWISS-Crimping-AWG28-20-Terminals-Connectors/dp/B078WNZ9FW/),
  but any that handle 0.35 mm² (22 AWG) terminals should work fine.
- **Scissors:** For cutting wire and tape.
- **Wire Strippers:** Anything that can strip 0.35 mm² (22 AWG) wire works.

## Wiring Diagram

Your connector layout may look different depending on chassis, but the wiring
functions are consistent: **signal, ground, and power.**

<div className='mt-8 mb-12'>
  <span className='text-lg font-bold'>
    In this diagram, A22 (mirror) connects with X18246 (10-pin connector):
  </span>
  <div className='h-2' />

      largeSrc={`${IMAGE_DIR}/connector-wiring_full.jpg`}
      alt='Wiring Diagram'
    />
  </div>
</div>

**The relevant wires are:**

- **Pin 1 — S_RS+**: signal wire for the mirror's auto-dimming function
- **Pin 3 — 15&lt;24**: switched power (Terminal 15, Fuse 24)
- **Pin 10 — 31E**: ground

<div className='mt-8 mb-12'>
  <span className='text-lg font-bold'>
    Here is the pin layout for the connector itself:

  <div className='h-2' />

      alt='Connector Diagram'
      aspectRatio='16/9'
    />
  </div>
</div>

<Callout type='info'>
  If you sourced your connector from a mirror at the junkyard you may notice
  extra wires on pins **4, 5, 6, 7**. These are for outside mirror dimming and
  can be disregarded or this retrofit.
</Callout>
<Callout type='warning'>
  **Important:** This wiring diagram is specific to my E83. Pin destinations may
  differ between models, but the wires coming **out of the mirror itself** are
  consistent. Your fuse will **not** be the same.
</Callout>

### Wiring to Chassis

<div className='mt-5'>
  Now this is the part where you'll have to consult your specific vehicle's
  wiring diagram, as it will be different for every model.
</div>

#### Shortcut Wiring Method

<div className='mt-5'>
  If you want a simpler approach, you can tap into nearby switched power and
  ground instead of running wires all the way to the fuse panel.
</div>

**For example:**

- **Power (Terminal 15)** → use the sunroof harness
- **Ground** → nearby ground point

<div className='mt-5'>
  Because the mirror's current draw is very low, this is generally safe.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  You will still need to run the **S_RS+ signal wire** to a valid connection
  point. In many cases, tapping into the existing run is sufficient if the
  signal is already shared with other systems. If not, route the wire directly
  to the originating module.
</div>

<Callout type='warning'>
  Always double-check what you tap into. Never splice into safety-critical
  systems such as airbags.
</Callout>
