# Using `fuckai.sh`

Detects emoji usage in your project files so you can decide whether it's intentional, stylistic, or accidental.


## Usage

### 1. Install the script

Place `fuckai.sh` in your `scripts/` directory (or anywhere you prefer—just adjust paths accordingly), then make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/fuckai.sh
```

### 2. Configure ignored files (optional)

Create a `.fuckai` file in your project root to ignore specific files or glob patterns.

Example:

```txt
node_modules
dist
*.lock
```

### 3. Run the script

From your project root:

```bash
./scripts/fuckai.sh
```

---

## Node / `package.json` Integration (Optional)

If this is a Node-based project, you can wire the script into `package.json` for convenience:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "fuckai": "./scripts/fuckai.sh"
  }
}
```

Then run it using your package manager:

```bash
npm run fuckai
# or
pnpm fuckai
# or
yarn fuckai
```

You can also hook this into **lint-staged**, **pre-commit hooks**, or **CI** if you want enforcement instead of advisory checks.

## Notes

* Designed to be minimal, fast, and dependency-free.
* Never modifies files, only scans and reports findings.
* Best suited for documentation-heavy codebases in solo workflows, where AI-assisted drafting is used without sacrificing consistency.
