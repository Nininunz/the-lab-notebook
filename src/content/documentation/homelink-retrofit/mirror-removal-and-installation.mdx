# Mirror Removal and Installation

<div className='mt-5'>
  This process involves carefully removing the existing mirror and installing
  the new one. The procedure is the same whether you're replacing a basic mirror
  or upgrading from a factory electrochromic unit.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes</div>
<div>**Tools Required:** Nothing special, just your hands</div>

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Mirror Trim

<div className='mt-5'>
  This step is straightforward. The trim cover design may vary slightly between
  models, but the removal method is the same. Unclip the cover carefully, then
  swivel the mirror as needed to fully detach the trim once it's loose.

### Step 2: Unplug Mirror Connector

<div className='mt-5'>
  Locate the main connector block at the top of the mirror. Some vehicles may
  have additional smaller plugs, but the large multi-pin connector is the one
  you need. Gently move any surrounding wires aside for easier access, then
  unplug the connector.

### Step 3: Detach Mirror from Windshield

<div className='mt-5'>
  Use caution during this step — the mirror mount is bonded to the glass, and
  forcing it incorrectly can crack or shatter the windshield. Support the mirror
  with both hands and rotate it **to the right** to release it from the mount.
  Do not apply pressure in any other direction.

<Callout type='info'>
  **Pro Tip:** For safe removal, ensure moderate temperatures (18-28 °C / 64-82
  °F). If the car has been in extreme heat or cold, let it sit indoors or under
  shade for 30 minutes to reduce stress on the glass.

### Step 3.5: No Pre-Existing Connector

<div className='mt-5'>
  If your vehicle was not equipped with an electrochromic mirror from the
  factory and you do not find a connector behind the mount, skip ahead to
  [Adding a Harness](`${DOC_DIR}/wiring-the-new-harness`). Otherwise, proceed
  directly to Step 4.
</div>

### Step 4: Install the New Mirror

<div className='mt-5'>
  Position the replacement mirror on the windshield mount and rotate it **to the
  left** until it locks in place. Reconnect the main harness plug, then
  reinstall the trim cover. When refitting the trim, pay close attention to any
  additional wiring for options such as the rain sensor, auto-beam assist, or
  other mirror-mounted features to avoid pinching or misrouting wires.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>In short — complete Steps 1-3 in reverse order.</div>

### Step 5 (Optional): Compass Calibration

<div className='mt-5'>
  If the new mirror's compass is inaccurate or displays a **"C"**, calibration
  may be required.
</div>

- **Magnetic Zone Setting:** Press the hidden button until a number shows,
  then cycle to the correct zone for your region.
- **Calibration:** Press until **"C"** appears, then drive 2-3 slow circles
  (~10 mph) until the direction display returns.

  Calibration is only necessary if the compass does not function correctly after
  installation.
