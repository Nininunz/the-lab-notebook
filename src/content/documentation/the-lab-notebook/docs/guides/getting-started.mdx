# Getting Started

Welcome to The Lab Notebook! This guide will help you get up and running with the project, whether you're contributing to the codebase or setting up your own instance.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0 or later
- **npm** or **pnpm** (recommended)
- **Git** for version control

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd the-lab-notebook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Project Overview

The Lab Notebook is built with:

- **Next.js 15** - React framework for production
- **Nextra** - Documentation framework built on Next.js
- **MDX** - Markdown with embedded React components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## Key Concepts

### Content Structure

Content is organized in the `content/` directory:

- `content/index.mdx` - Homepage content
- `content/projects.mdx` - Projects listing page
- `content/project/[project-name]/` - Individual project directories

### Project Metadata

Each project directory contains a `_meta.js` file that defines:

- Navigation order and display names
- Page visibility (hidden/visible)
- Project-specific metadata

Example `_meta.js`:

```javascript
export default {
  index: 'Project Overview',
  'getting-started': 'Getting Started',
  conclusion: {
    title: 'Conclusion',
    display: 'hidden',
  },
}
```

### Components

The project includes several reusable components:

- **FeatureCard** - Project showcase cards
- **LightboxImage** - Images with lightbox functionality
- **Project utilities** - Helpers for project content

## Your First Contribution

1. **Create a new project:**

   ```bash
   mkdir content/project/my-new-project
   ```

2. **Add metadata file:**

   ```javascript
   // content/project/my-new-project/_meta.js
   const meta = {
     index: 'Overview',
   }

   export default meta
   ```

3. **Create content file:**

   ```mdx
   # My New Project

   Description of your project here.
   ```

4. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
