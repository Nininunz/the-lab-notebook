# The Mysterious BMW N52 Engine Failure

<div className='mt-5'>
  This story doesn't really have a point—just thought it was interesting and
  weird. Never seen anything like it and can't explain it.
</div>

## The Discovery

<div className='mt-5'>
  I purchased a scrap LCI E83 a few weeks ago and finally got around to tearing
  into it. Being an N52 with no compression, I figured it was likely
  VANOS-related. The engine isn't known for piston ring issues, so I was
  hopeful.
</div>

## Initial Investigation

<div className='mt-5'>
  The engine had the VANOS recall completed about 6 months prior, so I didn't
  know what to think. I've seen VANOS bolts fail after they were supposedly
  replaced in the past, so I thought that was a possibility, though unlikely
  given the recency.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  The previous owner brought it in for a no-start condition. I got the paperwork
  from them and it had some notations about the work done:
</div>

- Several VANOS bolts were broken and the oil pan had to be dropped to collect
  them
- A broken head bolt was found in the pan (quoted something absurd to
  replace)
- The engine "ate a belt" and pulled pieces out of the pickup tube

Honestly, I thought the broken head bolt was BS. How does that even happen?

## The Plot Thickens

<div className='mt-5'>
  I got my borescope and checked the intake cam—all bolts were intact. Unable to
  see the exhaust cam due to the valve cover design, I had to pull it off. To my
  surprise, all exhaust cam bolts were intact as well. But yeah, there was a
  broken head bolt. Wild.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  At this point I didn't know what to think. When scanning codes earlier, I
  noticed the temp gauge was pegged high even with the engine off (just ignition
  power). The previous owner mentioned it was overheating before it died.
</div>

## Theory Formation

<div className='mt-5'>
  Now I'm thinking the head was ridiculously warped — further supported by the
  fact that the head bolt broke — and that the head gasket had somehow blown
  across all cylinders. Far-fetched, I know, but I don't have any other
  explanation.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  I tested compression once more for my own sanity—still 0-20 PSI across the
  board.
</div>

## Going Deeper

<div className='mt-5'>
  Now I'm invested. I don't care about fixing it; I just want to know what
  happened. So I pulled the head (not easy, by the way). The broken bolt being a
  stud meant I had to bring the head straight up. The configuration of the
  engine bay makes it impossible to pull the exhaust manifold back enough to
  clear the head without being able to move the head itself. Yeah, not fun. The
  engine wasn't designed for this car, so most of its setup was an afterthought.
</div>

## The Shocking Discovery

<div className='mt-5'>
  The head came off. **The gasket was intact. No signs of failure.**
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  Beyond confused, I called it a night—it was dark out and I was tired.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>The next day I tore into the head:</div>

- No cracks
- Brake cleaner poured straight out closed valves
- Removed the valves from the head
- The valve seats had **zero exposed metal whatsoever**
- Same goes for the valves

<div className='mt-5'>But damn, those valves looked bad.</div>

## The Unexplainable Part

<div className='mt-5'>
  There was easily a **millimeter-thick coating of carbon** on all surfaces,
  including the seat.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  Honestly, I can't explain how that even happens. It doesn't matter the amount
  of carbon or oil accumulating—that seat should always be shiny. The force of
  the valves opening and closing should keep it clean.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  I'll include pictures of the valves below. For reference, I've also included a
  valve from my N55 that has tons more buildup but still maintains a shiny ring
  where it should.
</div>

## The Mystery Continues

<div className='mt-5'>
  This remains one of the most bizarre engine failures I've encountered. The
  complete loss of compression across all cylinders with an intact head gasket
  and no visible damage is perplexing enough, but the carbon buildup on the
  valve seats defies explanation.

  Here's a few other pictures from the teardown process. I didn't take many. The

<div className='mt-5'>
  **Still can't explain it.** If you've seen anything like this before or have
  theories about how carbon can accumulate to this extent around the valve seats
  — to the point of zero compression — I'd love to hear from you.
