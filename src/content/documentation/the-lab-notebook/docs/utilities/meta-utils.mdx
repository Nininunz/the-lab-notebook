# meta-utils.js Documentation

The `meta-utils.js` file provides utility functions for working with project metadata files in the lab notebook. These utilities help enrich metadata objects with additional information based on the presence of related files.

## Functions

### enrichMetaWithDrafts(meta, metaFilePath)

Adds `todos` and `zero_draft` properties to the metadata object if corresponding files exist in the same directory as the metadata file.

#### Parameters

- `meta`: The metadata object to enrich
- `metaFilePath`: The path to the metadata file (used to locate related files)

#### Behavior

- If `todos.md` exists in the same directory, adds `todos: { display: 'hidden' }` to the metadata.
- If `zero_draft.md` exists, adds `zero_draft: { display: 'hidden' }` to the metadata.
- Returns the enriched metadata object.

#### Example

```js
import { enrichMetaWithDrafts } from '@lib/meta-utils'

const meta = { title: 'Project Title' }
const enrichedMeta = enrichMetaWithDrafts(meta, import.meta.url)
```

---

This utility is useful for conditionally including metadata fields based on the presence of draft or todo files in your project structure.

<Callout type='warning'>
  **Note:** Files marked with `display: 'hidden'` are still accessible by direct
  URL but are hidden from the sidebar navigation. These files should be removed
  for production releases to prevent public access to internal notes and drafts.
