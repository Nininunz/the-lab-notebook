# Choosing the Right Mirror

## Mirror Variants

BMW offered a wide range of rearview mirror options during the E83 era (and across many other E-chassis vehicles). Part numbers vary, but the main categories are:

- **Basic** — standard mirror - no wires, no auto-dimming
- **Electrochromic (EC)** — auto-dimming only
- **EC + HomeLink (GTO)** — auto-dimming with integrated garage door opener
- **EC + Compass** — auto-dimming with digital compass
- **EC + HomeLink + Compass** — auto-dimming with integrated garage door opener and digital compass

Additional variations exist, including styling changes and added features such as:

- **FLA** — High-beam assistant
- **ETC** — Electronic Toll Collection (not observed in NA market)
- **TLC** — Lane departure warning (rare on E-chassis, not observed in NA market)
- **Radio** — Radio-wave remote control (believed to be convertible-exclusive)

  Compass mirrors came in two versions: early models with a visible cutout, and
  post-2006 versions with a hidden display.

### General Notes

- **All electrochromic mirrors** include the **LED for the alarm system**, even if the vehicle is not equipped with an alarm.
- **Mirror housings differ** — a standard mirror housing will not always fit an electrochromic mirror and vice versa.
- **HomeLink and compass functions are independent** of the vehicle's CAN/K-Bus systems; they only require power and ground. This means if you already have an electrochromic mirror, you can often add HomeLink or compass simply by swapping in the upgraded mirror.
- **If your car is not pre-wired** for an electrochromic mirror, any EC mirror can be used to add the function — wiring just needs to be supplied.

### Market-Specific Features

- **ETC** is possibly exclusive to the Japanese market.
- **Radio-wave remote control** appears to have been limited to convertibles (though this may not be true).
- **Lane assist (TLC)** has not been observed on North American E-chassis models, though it likely existed elsewhere.

### Part Numbers

These are factory mirror options for a **pre-LCI E83**:

- `51169218046` — Basic mirror (non-EC)
- `51169134459` — Electrochromic mirror (EC) only
- `51169134458` — Electrochromic mirror with HomeLink (GTO) - no compass

Keep in mind these are only a few examples. BMW offered many variations across different models and markets.

  The mirror I used was pulled out of my blown up donor LCI E90.

<Callout type='info'>
  You don't need to source a mirror from the same chassis. Mirrors from other
  E-chassis vehicles of this era are interchangeable as long as the connector
  matches.
