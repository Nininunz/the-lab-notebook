# Introduction

<div className='mt-5'>
  This write-up documents my retrofit of a BMW HomeLink-equipped rearview mirror
  in my **2005 E83 X3**, which originally came with only a standard
  electrochromic (auto-dimming) mirror. Most of the information in this guide is
  actually irrelevant for my specific E83, since I had pre-existing wiring. This
  retrofit ended up being only a **10-minute endeavor**.
</div>

## Scope

<div className='mt-5'>
  While this guide primarily focuses on **HomeLink integration**, it applies to
  retrofitting:
</div>

- Electrochromic mirrors (auto-dimming)
- HomeLink (garage door opener)
- Digital compass mirrors

<div className='mt-5'>
  The information here should cover essentially all late-90s onward **E-chassis
  BMWs**.
</div>

<div className='mt-5'>
  For vehicles without pre-existing wiring, instructions are included for
  creating harnesses on the following platforms: **E38, E39, E46, E53, E60, E61,
  E63, E83**
</div>

<Callout type='info'>
  Always confirm wiring and connector presence before starting, especially on
  European-spec base models
</Callout>

<Callout type='important'>
  **WIP:** The project is complete, but documentation will be expanded when time
  allows.
