# Remote Start Adaptation

This write-up documents my effort to **adapt Alberto Marziali's remote start
project** (originally intended for F-chassis cars with BDC/FEM) to work on
earlier BMW platforms. My primary testbed is an **E90 with CAS3+**, but the
scope includes other CAS variants such as **CAS4 in the F10** and potentially
**CAS1 and CAS2 systems found in early-2000s 5/7 Series models _and possibly very early
E90s_**. I will also be using one of my F10s to validate CAS4 support, and
eventually porting the system to my **E83 X3 daily driver**, which I
previously retrofitted with CAS3.

## Scope

While the original project was tied to **KCAN2-equipped F-series**, this work
expands support to:

- `CAS1` based platforms (7 series)
- `CAS2` based platforms (1/3/5/6 series)
- `CAS3(+)` based platforms (1/3/5/6 series, X1/X5/X6/Z4)
- `CAS4` based platforms (5/6/7 series, X3/X4)
- Vehicles without Comfort Access (non-CA)
- Manual transmission vehicles

If you are unsure what CAS version your vehicle has, you can find what you have [here](https://www.transpondery.com/vehicle-security-systems/bmw-cas_fem_bdc-list.html).

  The project goal is to bring OEM-style **remote start functionality** to
  chassis that never supported it, while maintaining factory-level safety and
  immobilizer integrity.

<Callout type='info'>
  Current progress: **~75% hardware complete** (relays, wiring, CAN taps).
  Software and CAN message adaptation remain in progress.
</Callout>

<Callout type='important'>
  **WIP:** This is an active project. Documentation will be expanded as
  cross-platform support (non-CA, KCAN, manual gearbox) is validated.
</Callout>

## Future Roadmap

- IoT integration (Home Assistant, etc.)
