# `fuckai.sh` — Emoji Linting Script

A lightweight linting script for detecting emoji usage in project files.

It is primarily intended for validating **AI-generated mock data and documentation**, where emojis are often inserted arbitrarily and can introduce visual noise, stylistic inconsistency, or downstream parsing issues. The goal is not to ban emojis outright, but to surface them explicitly so their presence is always intentional.

The script is designed to be simple, fast, and predictable—well suited for solo workflows, documentation-heavy repositories, and automated checks where consistency matters.

## Use Cases

- Validating AI-generated mock data or documentation output
- Keeping README, MDX, and content files stylistically consistent
- Preventing emojis from silently leaking into structured or parsed data
- Enforcing output hygiene in fast-moving solo projects
