im unable to confirm at this time but it looks like bmw used the same windshield mount for the mirror going back to at least the e36. that would make this mirror almost plug and play if you wanted homelink and compass and didnt care about auto dimming. as ive mentioned, those work independently of the car so you could just run power and ground to the mirror and it would work. you could use 12v from the dome lights.
