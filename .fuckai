# Files and patterns to ignore when searching for emojis
# One pattern per line, supports basic wildcards
#
# Note: Common directories (node_modules, .git, dist, .next, coverage, .pnpm-store)
# are already excluded in the script for performance. Use this file for additional
# custom exclusions.
#
# File type configuration (optional):
# Use "type:" to include only specific file types (overrides defaults)
# Use "exclude:" to search all files EXCEPT the specified types
# Default: *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx, *.json, *.md, *.yml, *.yaml, *.sh, *.mjs
#
# Examples:
# type: *.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx
# exclude: *.json, *.yml, *.yaml

# Ignore the emoji search script itself
